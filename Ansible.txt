Ansible:
- Infrastructure automation tool
- Developed by Redhat
- Enables to tackle major challenges with infrastructure
- Infrastructure as code
- Configuration Management
- Orchestration & Deployment Tool
- Uses SHSH
- Favours Push Configuration

- Nearly anything a systems administrator does on a weekly or daily basis.
- Ansible is all about automation, it requires instructions to accomplish each job.
- Ansible doesn't depend on agent software and has no additional security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy.
- Ansible allows you to configure not just one computer, but potentially a whole network of computers at once, and using it requires no programming skills. 
- Instructions written for Ansible are human-readable, Ansible files are easy to understand.
- There are two categories of computers: 
	- The control node and managed nodes. The control node is a computer that runs Ansible. 
		- There must be at least one control node.
	- A managed node is any device being managed by the control node.
- Ansible works by connecting to nodes on a network, and then sending a small program called an Ansible module. 
- Ansible executes these modules over SSH and removes them when finished.

- A playbook is a configuration file written in YAML that provides instructions for what needs to be done in order to bring a managed node into the desired state.
- Playbook describes
	- How and in which order
	- At what time and where (on which machine)
	- What (module) should be executed
	- Has 1 or multiple plays
	- Yaml file

- Play
	- Which tasks
	- Which hosts
	- Which users
- Tasks
	- Multiple modules
	- In certain sequence
	- grouped together
- Modules 
	- Granular jobs
	- a small specific tasks
	- There are modules for almost all infrastructure related jobs
