i18n: Internationalisation / Localisation
- Uses Locale to identity language
- ResourceBundle class is used to load respective properties file based on locale
- Some locales are predefined, custom locales can be created.

Streams API
- It allows to process data in a declarative way
- Enhances the usability of Java collections
	- Making it easy to iterate and perform tasks against elements in collections
- Supports sequential and parallel operations
- Not a data structure
- Designed for Lambdas
- Categories of Stream operations
	- Intermediate operations
	- Terminal operations
- A stream pipeline consist of zero or more intermediate operations and a terminal 
- Stream is closed once terminal operation is performed
- Different type of stream operations are
	- Filter
	- Map
	- Reduce
	- Search
	- Sort

JDBC: Java Database Connectivity
- It is Java API to communicate with databases
- It uses different types of drivers to communicate with database
- JRE provides DriverManager service to handle drivers

Steps for JDBC
1- Identify appropriate database and driver
	- We choose MySQL and Type IV driver
2- Register driver with the Driver Manager
3- Request Connection from Driver Manager
4- Create Statement
5- Execute and get result

Types of Statements
1- Statement(I)
	- Used to perform fixed or hard-coded SQL queries
	- Compiled every time before execution
2- PreparedStatement(I)
	- Used to perform SQL queries with dynamic values
	- Represents Precompiled SQL queries
3- CallableStatement(I)
	- Used to invoke database stored procedures and functions

Select SQL queries returned results are represented as ResultSet(I) objects
- Result set is a record pointer, points before the first record fetched from database
- It stores Select query result in a logical table in memory for traversing
