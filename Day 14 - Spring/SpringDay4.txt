Servlets
- Capable of understanding HTTP requests

- It can handle different kind of contents like xml, json, etc.

JSON
ReST

MVC: Model View Controller
- Its a design pattern for Web Applications

Model: Represents data
View: Represents user interaction

SOA: Service Oriented Architecture
- Service is a set of functions/capabilities
- A service is a facility supplying required job
- SOA is a paradigm
	- It has distributed capabilities
	- It works under different ownerships
	- It helps build and manage complex applications
	- It helps build scalable and resoluble business systems

- Responding with different type of data based on clients is called
- Content Negotiation
Browser	--->	HTML
ATM		--->	Text
Angular	--->	JSON
Service	--->	XML

- A service/application generates different kind of response content
	based on the type of client

ReST ( Representational State Transfer)
- It is an implementation of SOA
- Very popular among modern applications
- As the name suggests it supports Content Negotiation
	- It can respond HTML, TEXT, XML, JSON
- It uses HTTP protocol for communication
	- It runs on top of HTTP

- It maps HTTP methods to CRUD operation
	- POST		--> 	Create
	- GET			-->		Retrieve
	- PUT			-->		Update
	- DELETE		-->		Delete

- Excludes boilerplate code from applications
- It promotes convention over configuration
- To reduce boilerplate code/configuration
- It supports ReST
	- It supports content negotiation
- It entertains requests from variety of clients
- It is designed for Micro-services
- It has support for Cloud
	- With Spring Cloud
- It makes JPA integration magical
	- With Spring Data
